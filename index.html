       <h2>What does Frontend really mean?<h2>
</section>
    <p>It’s the users experience directly, and it's all about how the web page looks.<br>That's why you need coding and styling to make the web page stand out.<br> A web page can’t only be fun and exciting it has to be stylish and functional as well.</p>
    <h3>The tools you need to know and mainly use are:</h3>

    <p id="html">HTML</p>
       <p>HTML is the coding language that will create, and structure the web content so it can be displayed in the browser.<br> You can make a very basic web page just with HTML, but that wouldn't be very interesting for the users experience.</p>

    <p id="css">CSS</p>
      <p>CSS is used to style the HTML elements at your web page. It’s a tool to define layout, colors and fonts.</p>

    <p id="java">JAVASCRIPT</p>
      <p>JS is used for more interactive elements such as dropdown menu’s, contact forms, modal window etc.<br>JavaScript is executed in the browser and it makes the web page more dynamic.</p>
